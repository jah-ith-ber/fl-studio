## Welcome to the unofficial FL Studio discord
---
Note: the server has a *verified* role. Verified means that you own a legitimate copy of FLStudio, and are a registered user on the Image-Line forum. The role grants you access to verified-only channels, such as #self-promotion. 

The #feedback-access channel *is* accessable by non-verified users. Just ask for the role, and note the channel rules below.

**If you own a license for FL Studio you can create a thread on the official IL forums [here](http://forum.image-line.com/viewforum.php?f=1989)**

- Please include your Discord ID in your post.
- Once you've created a thread with your Discord ID, send a moderator the link to your new verification thread - we'll grant you the Verified role.

### Server Rules:

1. No Piracy.
We only support musicians, creators, and developers in the music industry here. Do not post any links to pirated or infringing content. Discussion of the topic is also unwelcome here.

2. Be respectful to others.
No harassing other users, racism, bigotry, etc. If someone is harassing you, PM a mod. *Please don't randomly ping or PM @ moderator, chat mod, or any users without good reason. Ask any questions in #general and be patient.

3. No porn or other shocking content.
Any disregard may lead to an immediate ban.

4. Adhere to the channel topic written at the top of the channel on desktop or in the users panel on mobile.
No personal links or works outside of #self-promotion unless specifically asked or it's relevant to a conversation.

5. Keep personal links to a single channel only [No Spam!]
Don't post things in more than one channel at once for "maximum visibility".

6. Server suggestions in general.
We want this place to be somewhere enjoyable for everyone too. Suggestions and ideas are welcome and we do read them.

7. F1 (and Google) is your friend.
Pressing F1 in FLS brings up an indexed (Searchable) user manual. Query the manual and perform a Google search before asking too many questions please.

### Channel Specific Rules:

[#feedback-exchange](https://discordapp.com/channels/245006986490544129/501563193769066501)

Please post some honest feedback (with some thought and effort) to one or more people before you, and their tracks, *then* post your track and post looking for feedback. This way it keeps it fair for everyone, everybody gets at least some feedback and you are next. *If you don't yet own FL Studio, ask a mod (chat mods included) for the Feedback Access role.*

[#self-promotion](https://discordapp.com/channels/245006986490544129/245742738279104513)

Self-explanatory - Limited to verified FL Studio owners only.
